= oh lammy - explain your selection with ollama power

== Installation

before going to the extension store (if ever?), unfortunately you have to install it like a developer. but don't worry it's not difficult. Select `Extension Management` -> toggle `Developer Mode` -> click `Load unpacked`. Now choose directory with extension.

The default configuration points to `http://localhost:11434`, so if there is no need to change, all you need to do is refresh the model list and You can select the text.

== Usage

Select text on webpage, open context menu and choose `oh lammy`. When You click on one of submenu items, window should appear with AI explanation.

In configuration panel you can add your own *prompts*.

== Inspiration

Extension is strongly inspired by https://github.com/welniak/llama-explain. Ollama client code is basically from there. Project seams abandon so i hack this little, buggy thing to wipe my tears. Opinions, contributions. suggestions etc. highly recommended.
